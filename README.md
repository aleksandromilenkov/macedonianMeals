# macedonianMeals
I created React JS App for ordering traditional Macedonian meals.
This app is using Firebase as it's backend. I fetch the meals from the firebase.
You can add meals to your cart and then open the cart and you can manipulate further with your meals.
Finally when you choose what to order you can click Order and fill the form with correct values.
Then click Confirm and the food is ordered!
I store the order data in my database as well !
The app is hosted here: https://aleksandromilenkov.github.io/macedonianMeals/
